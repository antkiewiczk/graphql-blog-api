## README

This is a GraphQL based API for simple blog.

It includes few queries and mutations in order to create and fetch blog posts, as well as display feed.

Frontend part to be introduced.

## RUN PROJECT

In the project directory run:

### `yarn`

to install the dependencies. After that you can use:

### `yarn server`

to start development server. By going to localhost:4000 you will be able to see GraphQL playground
and browse through available queries and mutations.

### `yarn start`

starts front-end. For now it doesn't work too well.
